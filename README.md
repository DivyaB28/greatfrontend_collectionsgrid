# Collections Grid Section

## Project brief

In this challenge, you will develop a responsive featured collections section based on the supplied designs, which have been adapted for desktop, tablet and mobile views.

This section is a grid that displays the 3 collections on the e-commerce platform. It should be built to be dynamic, displaying up to 3 collections fetched from an API, each with a collection name, description and featured image as the background.

You will be provided with data pertaining to 3 featured collections to display in this section. To complete the functionality of this page, you should build the Product Listing Section, and filter by the relevant collection if the user clicks on the collection's card.
